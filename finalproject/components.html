                        <p>
                            The JACE® 9000 is a compact, embedded IoT (Internet of Things) controller and server platform for connecting multiple and diverse devices and sub-systems. With internet connectivity and webserving capability, the JACE 9000 controller provides integrated control, supervision, data logging, alarming, scheduling and network management. It streams data and rich graphical displays to a standard web browser via an Ethernet or wireless LAN, or remotely over the internet.
                            The licensing model for the JACE 9000 controller is simplified and features standard drivers, along with optional IO and field bus expansion modules for ultimate flexibility and expandability.
                            The JACE 9000 controller operates with Niagara 4, the latest version of the Niagara Framework®, for optimum performance. In larger facilities, multi-building applications and large-scale control system integrations, Niagara 4 Supervisors can be used with JACE controllers to aggregate information, including alarms, and historical and real-time data, to create a single, unified application.

                            These are Internet Protocol (IP) based “EDGE” controllers that can be used for VAV, unitary, equipment, and plant applications. Each controller is programmable and configurable using the open Niagara 4 Framework. Each controller is equipped with a four-port Gigabit network switch, that can integrate with broader IP peripheral devices including cameras, variable frequency drives, utility meters, lighting systems, etc. The CIPer Model 30 controllers can communicate over TCP/ IP (FOXS), BACnet, and Modbus protocols. These controllers can be used to aggregate information (including real-time data, alarms, trends, and history) and integrate this data to maximize the efficiency and lifespan of expensive facility equipment (assets) while helping prevent unplanned downtown.
