            <h2>What Is a Smart Building?</h2>
            <p>A smart building, or intelligent building, is a modern structure that uses advanced technologies to connect, analyze, and optimize its performance. Smart buildings give owners actionable insights that can improve building efficiency. They also enhance the comfort of the building’s occupants through features like variable climate control settings, automated daylight strategies, or biometric security.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing liveability with smart building solutions</h2>
            <p>Smart buildings allow a great degree of control over the environmental conditions of a building—for building managers, 
             this makes it possible to enhance livability for occupants. Smart building technology helps managers monitor data from the building in real time and make changes using integrated software.
             For example, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) settings can be changed to match temperature trends in the building and optimize thermal comfort for the occupants.
            
             Lighting systems can also be adjusted based on usage and seasonality. Smart building tech also makes it possible to review historical data to see where improvements can be made.

            <h2>What types of structures can be smart buildings?</h2>  
            <p>
              Smart building technology can be implemented in many types of structures, including office buildings, commercial buildings, 
              residential buildings, hospitals, hotels, schools, airports, industrial facilities, data centers, warehouses, and more. By integrating advanced technologies such as IoT devices, sensors, data analytics, and automation, these buildings can optimize energy usage, enhance occupant experience, improve security, and help streamline operations. Smart space buildings offer personalized services, real-time monitoring, 
              and data-driven decision making to create efficient, sustainable, and comfortable spaces.

            <h2>Smart building automation to power progress toward sustainability goals</h2>
            <p>Today, most businesses are trying to do their part to help the environment, and smart building
               solutions offer powerful tools. By using building systems such as lighting and heating in the most efficient manner possible, supported
               by accurate real-time data, companies can substantially reduce their carbon footprint. The resulting cost savings over time can be 
               substantial, helping ensure that smart building automation is a win financially as well as environmentally.

        <h2>Sensors: The key to smart building solutions</h2>
        <p>Some of the most important elements of smart building setups are the many sensors that measure and record useful data. These include:</p>

        <div class="info-cards">
          <div class="sensor-card">
            <h3>Temperature sensors</h3>
            <p>These smart building sensors allow constant monitoring of room temperatures, which can be vital for different settings, from residential buildings to manufacturing environments.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="sensor-card">
            <h3>Humidity sensors</h3>
            <p>Humidity sensors in smart buildings make it possible to measure relative air humidity, ensuring it’s kept at optimal levels for the situation, which can help avoid equipment rusting or limit the spread of bacteria.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="sensor-card">
            <h3>Occupancy sensors</h3>
            <p>Occupancy sensors detect whether a person is present in a specific space. This can then be used to automatically switch on and off lights and HVAC systems.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="sensor-card">
            <h3>Air quality sensors</h3>
